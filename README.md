# SKAFFOLD
<code><h1>__npm install -g skaffold__</h1></code>
Skaffold is an open source framework for creating ecommerce applications within minutes and hopefully it would be extended to other kinds of systems also. This is the initializer for a skaffolded project.

__STEPS TO INSTALL__
* open a terminal on your computer and run the following command <code>npm install -g skaffold</code>
* setup a new project by doing <code>npm init</code> in a new folder
* run <code>skaffold [Project name]</code> from your terminal in your project folder.
* if Project name is not supplied then skaffold uses the name of the current folder although you can still override it in the steps that follow.
* answer the questions that follow to setup your new application. pressing enter chooses the defaults for this application.
* then run the command <code>npm install</code>
* remember to create your database tables. at least until i add migrations.

Now your application is all setup. Have fun coding ;)
